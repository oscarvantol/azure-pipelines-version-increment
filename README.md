## how to build and pack
If you want something similar but different or just play around with the code be my guest. If you want to build it need to run some commands.
If you want to create your own from scratch, visit [the official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/get-started/node?view=azure-devops).

* install node
* npm install -g tfx-cli 
* npm run build-it
* npm run pack-it
